                <p><strong>Brandon George: </strong>The Cowboys are destined for their first losing streak of the season because their owner can’t bite his tongue. Jerry Jones continued to <a href="http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2016/12/13/jerry-jones-cowboys-know-time-tony-romo-definition-know-see">throw gasoline</a> on the club’s quarterback debate last week, not backing down even after <a href="http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2016/12/15/troy-aikman-just-dumbfounded-jerry-jones-comments-tony-romo?f=r">Troy Aikman criticized him</a>. Dak Prescott is coming off his worst game of the season in a loss Sunday at the New York Giants. He’s shown an uncanny ability for a rookie to bounce back every time something hasn’t gone his way this season. But this time, against a Buccaneers team that has won five consecutive games and is led by a stout defense, Prescott could be in for another rough outing. Jones will again have a chance to stir the pot when it comes to the Cowboys’ quarterback debate. <strong class="score">Buccaneers, 20-17</strong></p>

But what if the Buccaneers, who lead the league in takeaways, force an interception or fumble early Sunday night? Will he press to make up for it? Will he finally be fazed by the fact veteran Tony Romo sits on the bench, waiting for his chance to contribute this season? Most all Dak has done this season suggests otherwise, that he will plant his back foot to improve accuracy and find a way to reconnect with receiver Dez Bryant, and all will be merry and bright again in Cowboys Land. He should, calming worries as the postseason nears. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 24-17</strong></p>

            <div class="staff clearFix">
                <img src="images/_machota.jpg" alt="Jon Machota" />
                <p><strong>Jon Machota: </strong>As a rookie last year, Jameis Winston threw two interceptions and posted a 55.9 passer rating against the Cowboys. Winston and the Buccaneers still found a way to win, 10-6. The rematch will again be won by a rookie quarterback. Dak Prescott struggled last weekend against the New York Giants. Expect him to bounce back at AT&T Stadium. Tampa Bay’s defense has been very good during its five-game winning streak, but Prescott the runner could be the difference. After only one rushing attempt against New York, look for Prescott to use his feet more. Despite both efforts coming in losses, Russell Wilson rushed for 80 yards and Colin Kaepernick rushed for 84 against the Bucs this season. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 20-17</strong></p>

                <img src="images/_moore.jpg" alt="David Moore" />
                <p><strong>David Moore: </strong>Can a Cowboys team that went 91 days between losses wind up saddled with a two-game losing streak when this one is over? Sure. The Buccaneers are playing better going into this game than the Cowboys. They are strong defensively. It’s unrealistic to expect the Dallas offense to snap out of its offensive lethargy immediately. But there is something working in the Cowboys’ favor that wasn’t necessarily in place in past seasons. Home-field advantage. The Cowboys have won five consecutive games at AT&T Stadium, averaging 29.2 points in the process. Only two of those victories have come by fewer than 10 points, and both were against division opponents. It won’t be easy, but the Cowboys should get back on the winning track Sunday night. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 17-13</strong></p>

                    <p class="know">The Cowboys’ offensive line has certainly looked human for the last two weeks after bossing nearly every game for three months. Expectations are that the line will own a nasty disposition in this matchup. The Buccaneers are led by fantastic run-and-hit LB Lavonte David and big Gerald McCoy. The Cowboys must control the front and need better blocking from their tight ends.</p>

                    <p class="know">The Cowboys were the second-best team in the NFL on third down through 10 games but dead last the last two weeks. The Buccaneers, meanwhile, have allowed fewer third-down conversions than any other team. With pressure building, Dak Prescott needs to trust the offense and not force the ball in one direction. Tampa Bay’s pass rush can certainly cause problems.</p>

                    <p class="know">In his seven games, RB Doug Martin has not had a single game of 4 yards per carry. The Buccaneers’ young offensive line doesn’t strike fear in opponents but has a few nice pieces, led by Ali Marpet at right guard. For the Cowboys, Sean Lee is at the top of his game with his destruction of plays that move laterally down the line.</p>

                    <p class="know">There are weeks when young Jameis Winston can dominate with his big arm; he has thrown for multiple touchdowns in seven games. But Winston, as he did at Florida State, will try to fire some passes into tight spots and throw some interceptions. Even so, with 6-5 Mike Evans as a huge weapon for the Bucs, the Cowboys will face the type of threat they haven’t seen since facing the Browns’ Terrelle Pryor, who did not have a QB to supply the throws. Bigger receivers have always given Dallas fits.</p>

                    <p class="know">In trying to fix their special teams, the Buccaneers used the widely mocked strategy of taking a kicker in the second round of the 2016 draft: Florida State’s Roberto Aguayo, who is ranked last in NFL field goal percentage. Adam Humpheries is having one of the best punt return seasons in the league. Dallas’ special teams have not generated any big returns but also have prevented any.</p>

                    <p class="know">Tampa Bay has turned its season around with a five-game winning streak that includes a road victory over the Chiefs, followed by an equally rare hammering of the Seahawks. The Bucs have a stingy defense that will be physical and test the Cowboys. But Dallas feels urgency to secure the top seed in the NFC and to quiet its critics. Coming back home should be the difference.</p>

                    <h4 class="sectionLabel whiteTheme">Bob Sturm’s spotlight</h4>
                    <p><strong>Mike Evans</strong> is one of the most talented players in the NFL and a 6-5, 231-pound freak of nature. The Galveston product who spent two prolific seasons with Johnny Manziel at Texas A&amp;M has seemingly dominated every level of football he has ever played.</p>
                    <p>In two seasons at College Station, Evans accumulated 2,499 receiving yards and 17 touchdowns for the Aggies, producing jaw-dropping highlights and magnificent moments throughout. Now, at age 23, he has produced three straight 1,000-yard seasons and totaling 25 touchdowns since becoming Tampa Bay&rsquo;s first-round pick (seventh overall) in the 2014 NFL draft.</p>
                    <p> Evans can do it all as a receiver. He will not lose aerial battles and can run by defenders. He has worked hard to limit drops, which have been an issue, but his net contributions put him near the top at his position across the league, despite still being one of the youngest. The Cowboys secondary has seldom dealt with any receiver this size in 2016. This matchup will be vital.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sturm’s prediction: </strong>The Cowboys look a bit wobbly, but I fully expect Dak Prescott to quiet his doubters with the kind of bounce-back performance he has given all year. <strong>Cowboys, 24-17</strong></p>
