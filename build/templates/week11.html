                <p><strong>Brandon George: </strong>Sure, the Ravens have the best defense in the NFL. But nothing has slowed this Cowboys offense to this point. The only concern here for the Cowboys is if they get in their own way. Do the Cowboys allow all the Tony Romo drama over the last week to become such a distraction that it spills into game day? This team is a tight-knit group, and all indications are that the Cowboys won’t be fazed. Certainly, rookie quarterback Dak Prescott hasn’t flinched yet, no matter the challenge. Prescott won’t be looking over his shoulder Sunday. It’ll be full steam ahead as the Cowboys set a franchise record with their ninth consecutive victory in a season. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 23-17</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Kate Hairopoulos: </strong>The Ravens rank No. 1 in overall defense and in third-down defense and are tied for the league lead in three-and-outs forced (31). Baltimore also rates highly in defensive time of possession, allowing opponents to hold the ball for 27:51 per game. All of those lofty stats will take a hit against the Cowboys, particularly in the second half as Dallas opens up the game. Dallas leads the NFL with a 33:14 average time of possession and is also tops in drives of five-or-more minutes (24). The Cowboys rank fourth in the league with a .473 third-down conversion percentage. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 31-20</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Jon Machota: </strong>Baltimore has the NFL’s best rushing defense, holding teams to only 71.3 yards per game on the ground. The Cowboys have the league’s best rushing offense. Ezekiel Elliott and Co. are averaging 161 yards per game. Dallas faced a similar challenge in Week 6 at Green Bay. Elliott ended up going for 157 yards on 28 carries. Despite this being Elliott’s toughest test of the season, expect the MVP candidate to still go over the 100-yard mark. The Ravens wanted to draft Elliott. They tried to trade up to get him. The Cowboys are one of the teams they called. Cowboys fans should be thankful Jerry Jones declined. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 24-21</strong></p>

                <p><strong>David Moore: </strong>This game completes the Cowboys’ schedule against the AFC North. The outcome should fall in line with the previous three games against the division. Three of the Cowboys’ eight victories — which my calculator puts at 37.5 percent — have come against the AFC North. Dallas has averaged 32.7 points and won those games by an average of 14.6 points. The only game decided by less than two touchdowns came in Pittsburgh a few days ago. Baltimore is the first division leader the Cowboys have faced this season. But the Ravens are only 5-4 and play in a division that has offered minimal resistance against the Cowboys so far. Why would this game be any different? <strong class="score">Cowboys, 30-20</strong></p>

                    <p class="know">It isn’t exactly the days of Ray Lewis and Ed Reed, but Baltimore continues to roll out top performers at linebacker and defensive back. Now, it is CJ Mosely and Eric Weddle who stand out on a defense that’s in the top five in passing yards allowed and No. 2 to the Chiefs in interceptions with 11. The Ravens consistently jump routes, so Dak Prescott must be mindful of the lurking safeties.</p>

Devin Hester makes their kickoff return team formidable (third in the NFL), and this is one of the rare weeks where the Cowboys’ Dan Bailey will not have a decided advantage over the opposing kicker. Justin Tucker (Texas) is one of the best in the business and hasn’t missed a single kick all year.</p>

                    <h4 class="sectionLabel whiteTheme">Bob Sturm’s spotlight</h4>
                    <p>In a sport in which we worry about how long elite players can remain elite, it seems only quarterbacks and kickers can outlast a great pass rusher. When you look at Julius Peppers, DeMarcus Ware, Dwight Freeney, Robert Mathis, James Harrison and <strong>Terrell Suggs</strong>, it is clear that the best pass rushers can get into their mid- to late-30s and still turn the corner and get the passer.</p>
                    <p>Suggs, or “T-Sizzle,” as he is called, just turned 34 and is in his 14th season in Baltimore, where he has racked up 1121/2 sacks since being picked in the 2003 draft 10th overall out of Arizona State.</p>
                    <p>A relentless competitor, Suggs is still is a handful for any left tackle with his work rate and his athleticism. This is remarkable, not only because of his age and miles on the odometer but also because he has torn both Achilles tendons in the last five years in separate injuries. Overcoming what is often considered a career-ending injury twice, he still continually jumps off the tape.</p>
                    <p>Once again leading the Ravens in sacks, he is now playing with a torn biceps suffered a month ago yet still gets to the quarterback on a regular basis. There is no question that preparing for the Ravens requires a circle on the No. 55. He still can ruin a play by blindsiding a QB and often knocking the ball free in the process.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sturm’s prediction: </strong>The way Ezekiel Elliott is playing, it is hard to think there will be too many occasions when the offense won’t get into the 28-point range. The attack eventually will cool off, but with so many weapons for Prescott to use and so many ways to let Zeke make a difference, I don’t think it will happen this week, even against a stingy Ravens defense.</p>
