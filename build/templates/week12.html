                <p><strong>Brandon George: </strong>The key for the Cowboys will be finding a way to make a few stops. As we’ve seen, the offense will take care of the rest. But this Redskins offense has been on a roll, putting up 515 total yards and 42 points in a win over Green Bay on Sunday night. The Cowboys’ defense has shown holes in the back end, with injuries to safety Barry Church and cornerback Morris Claiborne. The Cowboys have allowed 10 plays of 20-plus yards over the last two weeks after having given up only six over their previous four games. The Redskins thrive on big plays. Against the Packers, the Redskins had six plays of 20-plus yards, including four for over 40. The Cowboys have to limit big plays and not allow Washington to rack up yards after catches.  <strong class="score">Cowboys, 34-30</strong></p>

                <img src="images/_hairopoulos.jpg" alt="Kate Hairopoulos" />
                <p><strong>Kate Hairopoulos: </strong>Washington cornerback <a href="http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2016/11/22/josh-norman-praises-dak-prescott-redskins-rb-know-nobody-likes-dallas-cowgirls?f=r">Josh Norman</a> didn’t shadow Dallas receiver Dez Bryant for all of the first NFC East meeting in Week 2. Bryant burned Washington for his first 100-yard game of the season. Norman will take on a bigger role against Bryant for Turkey Day, especially with <a href="http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2016/11/23/new-look-cowboys-offense-dez-bryant-become-even-nightmare-man-cover">Bryant heating up</a> and recording his first multi-touchdown game since 2014 in Sunday’s win over Baltimore. But quarterback Dak Prescott and the Cowboys’ offense have continued to prove that one of their biggest strengths is the ability to share the ball. Heck, maybe it’s even overlooked tight end Gavin Escobar, who makes a game-changing catch in this one.  <strong class="score">Cowboys, 31-24</strong></p>

As good as Dak Prescott has been, the Redskins will make him try to beat them with his arm. It’s not that they don’t respect the rookie quarterback. It’s because Ezekiel Elliott plus the Cowboys offensive line equals the NFL’s scariest rushing attack. If Zeke goes off, the Redskins don’t stand a chance. So the outcome will depend on how well Prescott handles seeing a defense for the second time. He hasn’t faced that test yet. However, judging by the results of all his previous exams, it seems silly to bet against him. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 27-23</strong></p>

                <p><strong>David Moore: </strong>The Cowboys’ wins have been by an average of 11 points. That margin would be even higher if not for those pesky division opponents. The Cowboys’ nine-game winning streak began with a four-point win over Washington on Sept. 18. The Cowboys came back six weeks later to nudge Philadelphia by six points, in overtime. The team’s only loss came to the New York Giants in Week 1. Sense a trend? The Cowboys own the NFL’s best record, but that doesn’t strike fear in the hearts of their <a href="http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2016/11/22/cowboys-keep-winning-games-season-can-win-right-games?f=r">NFC East rivals</a>.

                    <p class="know">The Cowboys are starting to see teams attempt to stop the run with more and more aggressiveness in an attempt to slow down Ezekiel Elliott. This is far easier said than done, as the Cowboys have conviction and feed the ball to Elliott over the course of the game. Dallas is just so tough inside, but if anyone can hold their own it is interior force Chris Baker. He has been taking over games lately and will offer resistance. That said, the Redskins are not very good as a team stopping the run, and I would expect another big day for the boys up front and Elliott.</p>

                    <p class="know">This is one component that will be vital for the Cowboys, who at times have had difficulty in pass protection against Washington. Only once this season has Dallas allowed more than two sacks in a game. That was in Week 2 when Washington got to Prescott four times. Trent Murphy, Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith are strong on the edge, while Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland continue to play well on the outside. Last week, Green Bay found its tight end repeatedly in space, so look for Dallas to attempt to expose the safeties with Jason Witten and Cole Beasley.</p>

                    <p class="know">One rather surprising development from Washington’s season is the discovery of a running game. It is yet another credit to offensive line coach Bill Callahan that a young, undrafted free-agent rookie Robert Kelley (Tulane) is running well the last several weeks since taking a job many figured was Matt Jones’. Behind big right guard Brandon Scherff and friends, Kelley has carved out 67 carries for 321 yards (4.8 per carry) over the last three games. Dallas had better be ready to take on a heavy dose of running on early downs. Baltimore certainly found some lanes early on that will encourage Washington.</p>

                    <p class="know">Without question, Washington has dazzled the league with its ability to stress secondaries with the deep ball during a run that has them with only one loss since Week 2. They repeatedly hit home run passes and allow Kirk Cousins to use play-action with top-level pass protection and an ability to drop beautiful bombs into the waiting hands of his speedsters. They can cause matchup issues all over the field with an elite tight end in Jordan Reed and a stable of sprinters on the outside. Dallas should be prepared to protect centerfield with numbers. They also are so tough on third downs.</p>

                    <p class="know">Whether it’s part of the offense or returning punts, Duke’s Jamison Crowder is pure speed and electricity. He is so elusive and difficult to break down that he provides Washington yet another game-breaker. Dan Bailey is the better kicker than Dustin Hopkins, but Washington covers kicks and punts well. We will give a small edge for Washington, but also will keep in mind that Lucky Whitehead seems closer and closer to breaking a major return.</p>

                    <p class="know">This is a massive game for both teams for a number of reasons, and both share a self-belief as they enter this game on impressive hot streaks. The advantage will swing to the home team despite the recent memory of the Redskins spoiling Thanksgiving Day in 2012 with a win that many thought was ushering in a new era of Redskins’ dominance with rookie QB Robert Griffin III of Baylor. It was merely a mirage, and one that Dallas would love to erase with a decisive victory to all but eliminate their rival from the division race.</p>

                    <h4 class="sectionLabel whiteTheme">Bob Sturm’s spotlight</h4>
                    <p><strong>Kirk Cousins</strong> is one of the most interesting stories in the NFL based on his odd offseason during which his team offered him a contract in February, which he didn’t care for, then didn’t change the offer all summer. Therefore, Cousins is playing under the franchise-tag deal of a little under $20 million for 2016 and was basically told by his organization to prove his quality again.</p>
                    <p>So, the 28-year-old has done better than that, continuing his aerial attack that has put his statistics up among some of the more celebrated names in the sport. Few players throw a better deep ball, and now he has added efficiency on third down and can face down and burn blitzes regularly. He spreads the ball around and is able to move the offense with 309 passing yards per game, and he generally doesn’t throw the ball to the opponent.</p>
                    <p>He is famously competitive and emotional, yet continues to be marginalized after dropping out of the top 100 picks in the 2012 draft. Now he again has the Redskins in reasonable position for postseason play and could stand to justify a massive new contract from Washington, who can’t help but be convinced of his quality. Questions still surface about his ability, but he has provided most of the answers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sturm’s prediction: </strong>There is no question that Washington is a better team than many predicted when the season began. That said, Dallas is too tough to deal with on a short week at home when Washington was forced to play Sunday night then travel with a team that sustained several injuries in the process. Dallas continues to roll. <strong> Cowboys, 31-26</strong></p>
