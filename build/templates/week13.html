                <p><strong>Brandon George: </strong>The Cowboys have the <a href="http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2016/11/30/teams-scare-cowboys-playoffs?f=r">playoffs on their minds</a> in Week 13. They can become the first team to clinch a playoff berth with a win Thursday and either a Tampa Bay loss or tie or a Washington loss on Sunday. Minnesota is the best defense the Cowboys have faced all season, but Dallas shouldn’t need to light up the scoreboard. The way the Cowboys’ offense is playing, the sputtering Vikings’ offense will have a hard time keeping up. If the Cowboys can get to 20 points, they should pull away from a team that needs takeaways to stay in games. The Cowboys will extend their winning streak to 11 games and keep the pressure on the fast-rising Giants.  <strong class="score">Cowboys, 24-13</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Kate Hairopoulos: </strong>Minnesota, loser of five of its last six games after opening the season 5-0, is the latest formidable defense to challenge the Cowboys. It allows just 17 1/2 points per game and 307 yards, among the best in both categories in the NFL. But Dallas continues to prove it has the offensive solutions over the course of four quarters. Quarterback Sam Bradford doesn’t have enough help to keep up. The Cowboys must continue to not turn the ball over — that’s the only way Minnesota, which is plus-12 in turnover margin, could end Dallas’ winning streak at 10.  <strong class="score">Cowboys, 28-17</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Jon Machota: </strong>No NFC team has intercepted more passes than the Vikings. Starting cornerback Xavier Rhodes is responsible for four of Minnesota’s 12 picks. The entire Cowboys team has four interceptions. Rhodes, a 2013 first-round selection, won NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors last week after intercepting two Carson Palmer passes and returning one 100 yards for a touchdown. Dez Bryant should see a lot of Rhodes. Bryant is listed at 6-2, 220 pounds. Rhodes could be a good physical matchup at 6-1, 218. Dak Prescott has been exceptional taking care of the football, throwing only two interceptions. I think No. 3 comes Thursday night. But the Cowboys still improve to 11-1. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 28-27</strong></p>

                <p><strong>David Moore: </strong>The playoffs are five weeks away. Minnesota isn’t likely to be there once they do start. The Cowboys will. Whether Dallas clinches a spot this weekend — which it can do with a win and a Washington loss or a Tampa Bay loss or tie — or the next week, it’s only a matter of time. But this is the sort of game that will help prepare the Cowboys for what lies ahead. Minnesota features an outstanding defense. Their secondary will challenge Dak Prescott’s accuracy and decision-making in a way no other team has. Facing the Vikings defense in a loud, hostile environment 12 days after the Cowboys went toe-to-toe with Baltimore’s physical group will sharpen this offense going forward. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 23-13</strong></p>

                    <p class="know">The Vikings’ run defense continues to be anchored by big Linval Joseph inside and an exceptional group of interior players who carry out Mike Zimmer’s tough style with tenacity and physicality. That said, their performance against the run has been spotty and their time on the field because of a subpar offense has remained an issue. Meanwhile, the Cowboys rushing attack has been consistently powerful all season and has yet to meet its match. Look for a determined play-calling effort to get Ezekiel Elliott front and center to avoid passing situations in a loud environment.</p>

                    <p class="know">There is no question that Minnesota’s entire defensive design is based on slowing down passing games and making quarterbacks panic and take underneath throws rather than standing in the pocket and getting clobbered. Pass protection will be vital, and the Vikings have first-round picks all over this talented defense. Only Denver gives up fewer yards per pass, and the Vikings also pick off passes with regularity. The Cowboys have not seen a pass defense on this level this year.</p>

                    <span class="edgeLabel">Edge</span><img class="edge" src="images/_cowSig.png" alt="Cowboys" />
                    <p class="know">There is no way to overstate how bad the Vikings are at running the ball. Only four offenses since the NFL-AFL merger have averaged fewer yards per game than the 2016 Vikings with 71.1 yards per week. And do not blame it all on Adrian Peterson’s health. The offensive line was below average before it became riddled with injuries. The Cowboys are seldom going to feel like they have a decided advantage at slowing down an opponent’s running game, but this is the exception. The Vikings simply cannot run the ball.</p>

                    <p class="know">The single redeeming quality of the Vikings offense is that they do not turn the ball over. Sam Bradford has completed many underneath passes to nonvertical threats and has done so without giving the ball away. Only Buffalo and Dallas have fewer giveaways this season. If injured receiver Stefon Diggs is available, it will provide Minnesota with one receiving threat, however. The Vikings’ poor pass protection sabotages any plays that require time. They resort to trick plays and sleight of hand for any offense they can find.</p>

                    <p class="know">Since being taken in the first round in 2013, Cordarrelle Patterson has been a massive disappointment as a receiver, but as a return man, nobody is in his class in the league. He has almost 600 more kick return yards than the next, closest man during that span. All he needs is a small seam and he is gone. And if he breaks one, the Vikings usually win. Beware.</p>

                    <h4 class="sectionLabel whiteTheme">Bob Sturm’s spotlight</h4>
                    <p>In a recent poll of NFL players, <strong>Harrison Smith</strong> was ranked above all Minnesota Vikings except the legendary (and injured) Adrian Peterson. Smith is a superb safety. He is underrated by the public, but opposing players and coaches know that to be successful against the Vikings, you had better figure out how to keep Smith from ruining your game plan.</p>
                    <p>He has phenomenal range and athleticism but also brings physicality and the ability to make plays behind the line of scrimmage. Most impressively, like any safety worth his salt, he studies hard. This allows him to anticipate the opposition’s plans, step in front of passes and make game-turning plays in the other direction.</p>
                    <p>“Harry the Hitman” was a first-round pick out of Notre Dame in 2012 and has been everything GM Rick Spielman hoped for when he drafted the dynamic play maker. Smith manages to stay out of the spotlight off the field, but when you put on the tape you can see that he does many things well that lead a team to success.</p>
                    <p>Signed to a five-year deal this summer that compensates him as an elite-level player, Smith has had another big year but has been playing with a problematic ankle. He will certainly have designs to cause Dak Prescott and the Dallas offense problems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sturm’s prediction: </strong>The only way to take down the Cowboys’ offense is to score enough points to overcome what they will take. That requires figuring out how this Vikings offense can get to 28 points. They will hope for a takeaway touchdown, but Dak Prescott and the Cowboys turn the ball over very little. This is a great test for the young Cowboys against a Vikings defense that is very impressive — especially in their own, loud building. <strong>Cowboys, 24-17</strong></p>
