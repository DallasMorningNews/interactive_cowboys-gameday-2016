                <p><strong>Brandon George: </strong>Neither team has anything to play for in this regular-season finale. The Cowboys have the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs already secured, and the Eagles aren’t going anywhere but on vacation after this one is over. The Eagles also didn’t have anything left to play for a week ago when they hosted the Giants. And the Eagles beat a Giants team that needed to win to remain alive for the NFC East title. The Cowboys won’t play some of their starters and the others probably won’t be in long. But this is a deep Cowboys team, and several players who will finish this game are playing for future contracts, including running back Darren McFadden and quarterback Mark Sanchez.  <strong class="score">Eagles, 20-17</strong></p>

                <img src="images/_hairopoulos.jpg" alt="Kate Hairopoulos" />
                <p><strong>Kate Hairopoulos: </strong>The Cowboys have said all the right things about playing to win the regular-season finale at Philly. Rookie quarterback Dak Prescott even espoused about the value in facing a division rival he’ll be seeing for years to come. But it makes no sense to risk losing key players to injury in a meaningless game just before the playoffs. That’s why Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott will only make cursory appearances, just enough to feel like the momentum continues. Cowboys who have been managing or playing through injuries will sit. Dallas will have to dig deep just to field a defensive line rotation. Let’s get this done and move on to the real show. <strong class="score">Eagles, 24-17</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Jon Machota: </strong>The starters aren’t expected to play much, so the result will likely be the least entertaining game of the season. It also means that one of the most impressive seasons in franchise history will end with a 3-3 division record. The players have been preaching the last two weeks about keeping their foot on the gas and building momentum. But it doesn’t make much sense risking injury in a game that has no impact on Dallas’ playoff position. The broken legs suffered by franchise quarterbacks Derek Carr and Marcus Mariota last week are a perfect example of how quickly things can change on a single play. <strong class="score">Eagles, 21-14</strong></p>

                <p><strong>David Moore: </strong>The Cowboys got this campaign underway with four preseason games. They end it with a fifth Sunday in Philadelphia. You may have heard by now this game carries absolutely no weight in the Cowboys’ upcoming playoff road. That’s been determined. But that doesn’t mean a loss is better than a win. These Cowboys have worked all season to forge a winning culture. Why would anyone expect them to adopt an attitude for this game that a win doesn’t matter? Key players won’t take the field for Dallas in this game. Some will take the field and not stay long. But that doesn’t mean the blueprint, discipline and determination they have displayed all season will be scrapped. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 23-20</strong></p>

We can anticipate a heavy dose of run plays from a Cowboys team looking to get through the game.</p>

                    <h4 class="sectionLabel whiteTheme">Bob Sturm’s spotlight</h4>
                    <p>When it comes to big signings and free agency, not many of Philadelphia’s grand plans have worked out over the last few years. But the signing of <strong>Malcolm Jenkins</strong> from New Orleans was a real find as he continues to be one of the top players on a very good defense.</p>
                    <p>Jenkins is a do-it-all safety, who seems to be at his best when he is allowed to patrol the field like a hybrid linebacker. But he also can cover most tight ends and slot receivers, offering ball-hawking abilities that are becoming more and more of a lost art. He is able to bait quarterbacks into throws and then jump the route. He also can also offer a well-timed blitz off the edge.</p>
                    <p>He’s another Ohio State Buckeye who is making a dramatic impact in the league. Jenkins just turned 29 and won NFC defensive player of the week for single-handedly destroying Eli Manning’s evening with two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown.</p>
                    <p>In February, when the Eagles were locking down many of their veteran players, Jenkins was signed for another five years. At this pace, it looks like he has plenty left and in some respects is improving with age.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sturm’s prediction: </strong>Eagles fans would enjoy beating Dallas while Cowboys fans just want to get the game over with so their team can heal up during the bye week. We will take the Cowboys because that has worked 13 of the last 15 weeks. <strong>Cowboys, 27-17</strong></p>
