                <p><strong>Brandon George: </strong>Sure, Pittsburgh presents a daunting road challenge for the Cowboys. The Steelers are one of the league’s top home teams. But this Cowboys team is on a roll and is no slouch on the road. The Cowboys have won 15 of their last 20 regular-season road games. They have already won at Lambeau Field this year against the Packers. They will conquer Heinz Field on Sunday to win their eighth consecutive game and improve to 5-0 on the road. The Steelers just got back quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and have been sputtering, losing their last three games. They won’t turn it around against a Cowboys offense that has dominated time of possession. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 27-24</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="staff clearFix">
                <img src="images/_hairopoulos.jpg" alt="Kate Hairopoulos" />
                <p><strong>Kate Hairopoulos: </strong>The Steelers are 3-1 this season at Heinz Field — a tricky place for Dallas to match the franchise’s longest winning streak at eight games. But that could make pulling it off all the sweeter. If the Cowboys are to do it, they’ll need rookie QB Dak Prescott to take care of the ball. That’s been a known quality of his for the most part, considering he didn’t commit a single turnover in his first four games. But before the Cowboys destroyed the lowly Cleveland Browns last week, Prescott had committed four turnovers (two interceptions, two fumbles) in three games, including three in the red zone. The Steelers have four interceptions and five fumble recoveries this season. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 28-24</strong></p>

            <div class="staff clearFix">
                <img src="images/_machota.jpg" alt="Jon Machota" />
                <p><strong>Jon Machota: </strong>The Steelers have been great at home for a long time. They’ve won 19 of their last 25 at Heinz Field. This will be the Cowboys’ toughest challenge since facing Aaron Rodgers at Lambeau Field. They won 30-16, making Rodgers look average. Will they do the same to future Hall of Famer Ben Roethlisberger? Big Ben had left knee surgery a month ago and struggled in his first game back last week. But he’ll be better at home. In his three home starts this season, Roethlisberger has thrown 12 TDs to only two INTs. For his career, Roethlisberger is 68-21 at home. Give me the two-time Super Bowl champ to pull it out in the fourth quarter. <strong class="score">Steelers, 27-24</strong></p>

                <img src="images/_moore.jpg" alt="David Moore" />
                <p><strong>David Moore: </strong>The Cowboys are the only team that hasn’t allowed a 100-yard rusher or receiver this season. That will change Sunday. Pittsburgh’s Antonio Brown is in the conversation when it comes to the NFL’s top receiver. Le’Veon Bell is a threat at running back. He rushed for 144 yards on only 18 carries against Kansas City in October. One or the other — and worst-case scenario, both — should end the Cowboys’ 100-yard shutout streak. Brown is the most likely candidate. But don’t discount Bell. It’s surprising no team has pounded away at this defense on the ground as a way to counter the Cowboys’ dominance in time of possession. Bell could be the first. <strong class="score">Steelers, 27-24</strong></p>

                    <p class="know">The most unlikely statistic that exists in the NFL these days has the Steelers tied for last in the league in sacks. “Blitzburgh” is trying to figure out how to rattle quarterbacks without exposing their very young secondary and are having a hard time getting consistent results.

                    <p>For years, the best receiver in the NFL was Calvin Johnson, the amazing receiver from Detroit who was known simply as &ldquo;Megatron.&rdquo; He was given that name as a tribute to his absurd physical advantages that started with a frame of 6-5, 240 pounds. He used that along with speed and leaping ability to accumulate production that was off the charts.</p>
                    <p>The Steelers&rsquo; <strong>Antonio Brown</strong> has put up dazzling numbers as well and has been the most productive receiver in the NFL since 2013. What may be surprising is that Brown does it at 5-10, 181 pounds. In 56 games, he has 430 receptions for 5,708 yards and 37 touchdowns, 700 more yards than Atlanta&rsquo;s Julio Jones.</p>
                    <p>Brown was taken with the 195th pick of the sixth round in the 2010 draft out of Central Michigan. He uses great speed, quickness and is a real technician to dominate on the perimeter. He wears No. 84 to show that &ldquo;eight times four equals 32&rdquo; for each team that passed on him in the draft.</p>
                    <p>Not only is he unstoppable, but he is drastically underpaid at about $8 million a year in a league where elite WRs receive about twice that. There is no question that he will be a focus of the Cowboys&rsquo; banged-up secondary as he tries to become the first 100-yard receiver against Dallas this season.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sturm’s prediction: </strong>The Cowboys have the best road record in the NFL since 2014 at 15-5. It’s even more impressive when you consider that they are 14-0 on the road (regular season) in games started with either Tony Romo or Dak Prescott. In other words, their game travels well and the normal trappings of a road challenge don’t bother a team with this dominant offensive line. Can Prescott pass yet another difficult test? I think so, but it won’t be easy or decided before the fourth quarter. <strong>Cowboys, 30-28</strong></p>
