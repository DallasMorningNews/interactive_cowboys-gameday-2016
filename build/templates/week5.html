                <p><strong>Brandon George: </strong>This Cowboys defense does have a takeaway in each of its first four games, a nice change of pace after the club tied an NFL record last season for fewest takeaways in a season with 11. But don’t be distracted by that or the 3-1 start, the Cowboys’ defense hasn’t been very good. The Cowboys have only five sacks, four fewer than the Bengals’ defensive line. And what’s been even more glaring: Through four games, the Cowboys have allowed 19 plays of 20 yards or more. A year ago, that number was only 11 given up at this point. Sunday’s game against the Bengals will be about big plays. Cincinnati will have more than Dallas. <strong class="score">Bengals 27-24.</strong></p>

            <div class="staff clearFix">
                <img src="images/_hairopoulos.jpg" alt="Kate Hairopoulos" />
                <p><strong>Kate Hairopoulos: </strong>Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott will be challenged to win a second straight week without receiver Dez Bryant, and this time against a Bengals defense that is pumped by the return of linebacker Vontaze Burfict after a three-game suspension. But it’s hard to imagine the Bengals coming out of AT&T Stadium with their streak of giving up zero rushing touchdowns this season intact. Ezekiel Elliott and the Dallas offensive line have been too good. The Cowboys defense will squeeze by against receiver A.J. Green and a Bengals’ offense that’s been shaky in the red zone. <strong class="score">Cowboys 24-21</strong></p>

                <img src="images/_machota.jpg" alt="Jon Machota" />
                <p><strong>Jon Machota: </strong>If the Cowboys can’t establish their running game they’ll be in trouble. The Bengals haven’t allowed a 100-yard rusher in their last 15 games. They haven’t allowed a rushing touchdown since December. Cincinnati has one of the best defensive units the Cowboys will face all year. Although Ezekiel Elliott and the offensive line have steadily improved each week, this will be their toughest test to date. The Cowboys don’t consistently win at AT&T Stadium, so I’m giving the edge to a Bengals team that has won 11 of its last 15 on the road and reached the playoffs the last five seasons. <strong class="score">Bengals 24-20</strong></p>

                <p><strong>David Moore: </strong>Are the Cowboys a team that has overcome early adversity to establish themselves a playoff contender? Does this surprising start portend more or is it destined to dissipate as the schedule becomes tougher? This game begins a stretch that should supply the answer. Cincinnati has made the playoffs five consecutive seasons. Dallas has failed to make the playoffs in five of the last six seasons. Beat a good team at AT&T Stadium, something the Cowboys have had trouble doing in recent years, and it will signal the Cowboys are on the rise. Lose and it will be hard to argue that this team is any different at this stage. <strong class="score">Bengals 24-21</strong></p>

Ezekiel Elliott won’t believe how much space he is getting.</p>

                    <p class="know">So much depends on the ability for Dez Bryant to play at an effective level. If he goes, he will still need to prove he can do special things against a defense that plays lots of zone and almost never blitzes with a heavily populated secondary.

                    <p class="know">Cincinnati is struggling to get its running game going this year, but Andrew Whitworth is the left tackle who sets the tone for this offense in a division (AFC North) where finesse has no chance to compete.

                    <h4 class="sectionLabel whiteTheme">Bob Sturm’s spotlight</h4>
                    <p>One of the reasons the Bengals are so impressive is they have two difference makers on their defensive line. Carlos Dunlap (second round) and <strong>Geno Atkins</strong> (fourth round) were selected in the 2010 draft. While Dunlap took a few years to figure things out, Atkins has been at the top of his position for most of his career.</p>
                    <p>That hit an obstacle in 2013 when Atkins tore his ACL, but last season he returned to elite status and his play in September verifies his excellence yet again.</p>
                    <p>Atkins is so quick that he often lines up in the 3-technique (outside shoulder of a guard), and the opposing guard can barely get out of his stance before Atkins is in the backfield. He is the rare combination of power and quickness that allows him to be equally devastating against the run and pass.</p>
                    <p> The combination of Dunlap and Atkins has made the Bengals the least likely team to blitz, and yet this defensive line can get consistent and dominating pressure all on its own. Cowboys guard Ron Leary is going to be tested heavily Sunday.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sturm’s prediction: Bengals 27-21. </strong>The Bengals are in the hardest part of their schedule, whereas the Cowboys are just getting started. This is another game that should require some fourth-quarter drama, but Dallas is 2-12 in Arlington as home underdogs. They have to prove they can handle heavyweights at home, and I am not sure they are healthy enough to do so.</p>
