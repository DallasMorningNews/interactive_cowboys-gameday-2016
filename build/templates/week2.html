                <p><strong>Brandon George: </strong>Dak Prescott didn’t turn over the ball in his first NFL start last Sunday against the Giants, and the Cowboys still lost at home. This week brings a much different test for Prescott: He’ll make his first NFL road start, against the rival Redskins. Sure, Prescott has played in front of louder crowds in the SEC than what he’ll see Sunday at Washington. But this is the NFL, which comes at you much faster. The Cowboys believe Prescott is their future. They’ll have a much better feel for that after Sunday. Winning your first road start as a quarterback is a tall task. Prescott will keep it close but falter late. <strong class="score">Redskins, 30-27</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Kate Hairopoulos: </strong>As Jason Garrett helpfully reminded us last week, running the ball in the NFL is hard. But it’s not as hard against Washington as it is against other teams. This will be the week rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott has some fun and finds some room to run behind a prideful offensive line that didn’t look as powerful as expected in run blocking last week against the New York Giants. Backup RB Alfred Morris will get his chances, too, against the team that drafted him and then let him go to its rival in free agency. As always, the run helps set up the rest of the offense. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 27-21</strong></p>

                <img src="images/_machota.jpg" alt="Jon Machota" />
                <p><strong>Jon Machota: </strong>All eyes will be on the matchup between Dez Bryant and Josh Norman. Things got heated between the two star players last Thanksgiving. Norman won that battle, holding Bryant to one catch for 6 yards on five targets. But the two-time Pro Bowl receiver wasn’t close to 100 percent, dealing with foot, ankle and knee injuries. Both players are healthy heading into Sunday’s game. Most believe Norman will shadow Bryant throughout, but there’s no guarantee. In Washington’s season opener, Norman was rarely on All-Pro receiver Antonio Brown. Against the Redskins, the Cowboys make a point to get Bryant more involved than they did last week, and he finishes with five catches for 75 yards and a touchdown. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 24-23</strong></p>

                <p><strong>David Moore: </strong>One team returns a key player who was down with pneumonia for a few days. The other team’s most vocal player decided to release all of his medical records on Dr. Oz. Oh wait, wrong contest. This is supposed to be about that other game that will be played outside of our nation’s capitol this weekend. The Dallas- Washington rivalry doesn’t generate the same hatred and intensity it once did. But both teams find themselves in a precarious spot this early in the season. A Cowboys loss would give them two division losses in two weeks and blunt the excitement Dak Prescott sparked during the preseason. A Washington loss would give the Redskins two home losses by mid-September. <strong class="score">Cowboys, 23-17</strong></p>

                    <p class="know">Here is where Dallas needs to respond with a big performance and a deliberate attempt to get the ball into the hands of Dez Bryant. Dak Prescott was careful with his throws, avoiding the middle of the field and coverage. But to win on the road, there must be times to challenge the defense. Look for defensive coordinator Joe Barry to try to bait the rookie QB with disguises in the pass rush and the seven-man coverages behind it. Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith bring plenty of heat.</p>

                    <p class="know">Bill Callahan’s zone running scheme started well last year, but by the end of the season the production was 30th in the league in yards per rush. Then the Redskins allowed Alfred Morris to leave for low money. And that has left them with almost nobody noteworthy to carry the ball. The good news for Washington is that Dallas was run over by the Giants and will surely be challenged again.</p>

                    <p class="know">On paper, the Redskins seem to have an impressive group of receivers, including their first-round pick, TCU’s Josh Doctson. But until they demonstrate any sort of change, their passing attack still appears to be forcing the ball to TE Jordan Reed and throwing horizontal passes to small receivers on the edge, with the occasional shot to DeSean Jackson over the top. Kirk Cousins generally won’t beat you with remarkable throws.</p>

Washington is not considered strong on special teams, but it improved in 2015 across the board.

                    <h4 class="sectionLabel whiteTheme">Bob Sturm’s spotlight</h4>
                    <p>The object of great intrigue during the Redskins’ offseason was their acquisition of cornerback <strong>JOSH NORMAN</strong> after an unexpected series of events allowed them to sign him quickly to a five-year, $75 million contract. The contract is the largest at his position in history, with a virtual guarantee of $50 million that is normally reserved for only the best quarterbacks in the business.</p>
                    <p>Norman is a fantastic story — a player who was marginalized in the draft process before being developed into a force in the Carolina secondary. The oddity is that because the Panthers play almost exclusively zone coverages, they do not wish to spend large sums on defensive backs. In other words, they feel that given the strength of their pass rush and zone scheme, their corners are replaceable.</p>
                    <p>The Redskins actually did well in coverage last year, which has many wondering about this record investment in something that did not appear terribly broken (perhaps similar to the Cowboys’ RB philosophy last spring). Further, on Monday night, they did not ask Norman to “travel” from side to side with Pittsburgh’s Antonio Brown, but rather stay on the defensive left side. He clearly has confidence against Dez Bryant, going back to last Thanksgiving’s matchup, but now all eyes are watching to see if he is asked to follow Bryant.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sturm’s prediction: </strong>The road team has won the last five in this series, and the teams seem like an even match. That said, the Redskins must bounce back on short rest, and Dallas has a QB making his first road start. Redskins, 23-21</p>
